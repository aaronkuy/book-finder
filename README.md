# Book Finder App

## Description 
This is my first usage of an API, where I focused more on the implemantation in JS.
That's why I made a very plain web design, so the focus is more on the book research 
tool itself. In the future you can combine it with other API's coupled with an adjustment 
of the the embillishment of the main format.

## Features 
- Interactive websites which is responsive to the user's input
- Show's the relevant information of a specific book
- Due to the implementation of the Google API, you have a universal acces to the whole book spectrum
- The entered book in the inpout is displayed visually on the webdesign

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- Java Script
- CSS
- Google Book API

## The things I've learned
- I was able to solidify already existing JS knowledge to an further extend
- Initial experiences with async, await and fetch
- Learning to make the overview of code blocks more structured and clear especiallly in JS.
